# AVAMAE Software engineering test

I couldn't get some of the included resources, namely the svg files, to load correctly.
Other than that, I think the only issues are some redundant CSS and the width/position of the input fields in the contact-us page.
I've had a lot more experience with Node than with CSS, but once I learn the best practices that are adhered to within AVAMAE I'm sure my CSS will be stellar.

To view the site, I'd run `npm install` and then `npm run start`.

Thank you for your consideration.
